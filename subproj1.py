# This is the first assignment:
# First, use range() and a while loop to sum the numbers from 1 to n (n=100 is a good default)
# Secondly, derive and use a formula to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n
# Finally, use time functions to determine the difference in speed between the two methodologies
